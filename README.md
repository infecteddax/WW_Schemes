# WW_Schemes
This is a small effort to implement a project which helps us implement subjects learned during SEM 6 of IT Engineering(Mumbai University).We have tried to implement our knowledge of Distributed Systems(DS), Data Mining and Business Intelligence(DMBI)and Software Engineerinng(SE) practically for our project. 
#DS
This system uses the  Google Maps API  to locate the NGO s nearby and also gets te route to the NGO whichever desired by the user. 
#DMBI
The system using Data Mining process predicts whether the scheme will be sanctioned or not with the help of NaiveBayes Algorithm.
#SE
We have created and used Activity , Class ,Component and Use-Case Diagrams  to help us understand our problem statement better.
